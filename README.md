## üîê Security Philosophy

Shush is built with the belief that:

- Your vault should never rely on the cloud unless **you** host it
- No GUI = fewer attack surfaces
- TOTP or PIN should protect your data even on compromised systems
- Passwords are never printed unless explicitly requested
- Keys and sensitive data are kept **in RAM only** when needed

> ‚ö†Ô∏è CSV files are treated as insecure and are deleted by default after import.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Roadmap

- [x] CLI interface and command structure
- [ ] Vault init, add, get, rm
- [ ] Clipboard support
- [ ] CSV import and secure deletion
- [ ] PIN and TOTP support
- [ ] Custom password generator
- [ ] Native image builds (GraalVM)
- [ ] Frontend dashboard (optional)
- [ ] Yubikey support
- [ ] Integration with distros/repos
- [ ] Auto-sync between machines

## üí° Use Cases

- Developers managing SSH credentials across servers
- Homelab admins who want offline-first password control
- Privacy-focused users who don‚Äôt want GUI-based managers
- Terminal nerds who want something fast and secure
